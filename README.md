Different intervention and test config process are in the ``result.ipynb`` file. Among them, 
* ``run_jobs()`` is the function of implmenting different algorithms along with results.
* ``run_falcon_fair()`` is the function of implementing action / individual temporal fairness to the standard FALCON algorithm.
* ``run_falcon_fair_loss()`` is the function of implementing group fairness to the standard FALCON algorithm.

The results (figures) are in the ``figure.ipynb`` file.
